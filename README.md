# Presentation_SelfClean

I collected 100 images from the HSLU campus in horw and 90 images 
from the Rotkreuz campus. The goal of the selfClean package
([Digital Dermatology - SelfClean Repository](https://github.com/Digital-Dermatology/SelfClean/tree/main))
 will be to detect data quality issues such as near duplicates, outliers and mislabeled iamges.  

## Mislabeled Image
I intentionally moved the image "Horw_2439.JPG," which was taken in Horw, into the folder for Rotkreuz.
The goal of the SelfClean 

## Outliers
Outliers are defined as images that are not taken on the campus of HSLU. They will soon be added to the dataset.

## Near Duplicates 
During the dataset collection, I took multiple images of the same object. The goal of the SelfClean package is to identify these images. 
These are my expected near duplicates:
